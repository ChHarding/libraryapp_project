#####USER GUIDE#######

#Requirements
-Some way to run a Python file (.py).

#Recommendations
-Some sort of software to open database files (.db)
  -This is so you can add field, delete content, etc.
  -I use db browser for sqlite (https://sqlitebrowser.org/)

#Bugs
- The edit selection is not currently functioning as intended.
- There is currently no way to delete a book without editing the database file.
